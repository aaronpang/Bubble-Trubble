This project was created by me, Aaron Pang and my friend Brandon Ma in grade 11 when we first learned Java. We wanted to develop a game that was RPG-like but not too deep as we did not have much time since we had school. We started and finished the project in 2 weeks over the Christmas break with ALL hand drawn graphics, animations, menus and sounds taken off the internet. The end product came out to be a fire-emblem or advance wars style game with controls identical to that of VBA (Visual Boy Advance) since we were addicted to that back then. 


HOW TO DOWNLOAD:

Download the .zip file or .tar.gz file and extract into a folder.
Click "Run Bubble Trubble" batch file.

OR

Compile and run BubbleTrubble.java with cmd or IDE.



WARNING: This game was designed with 1280 x 1024 screens with all the images and background made to accommodate this fact. Unfortunately we were brand new to java and did not do any re-sizing or anything like that, so make sure your resolution is large enough to see the entire game in its entirety. 



How To Play:

Arrow keys to select
Z - Enter
X - Cancel
In Game - Buttons 1,2,3,4 also select units as well.

TIP: When you are in game, you must click Z to access the left menu and end the unit's turn. You must end all of your unit's turns in order to switch turns with the other player. Also, you can press 1,2,3,4 to switch between your units. 

Refer to the help menu given in the game. (If you've ever played Advance Wars or Fire Emblem on VBA, this game is very similar in style and gameplay)
