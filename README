This project was created by me, Aaron Pang and my friend Brandon Ma in grade 11 when we first learned how to use Java. We wanted to develop a game that was RPG-like but not too deep as we did not have much time since we had school. We started and finished the project in 2 weeks over the Christmas break with ALL hand drawn graphics, animations, menus and sounds taken off the internet. The end product came out to be a fire-emblem or advance wars style game with controls identical to that of VBA (Visual Boy Advance) since we were addicted to that back then. 

To Play:

Arrow keys to select
Z - Enter
X - Cancel

Refer to the help menu given in the game.
